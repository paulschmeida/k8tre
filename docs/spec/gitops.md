  spec:
  refimpl: K8TRE will follow GitOps principles and will use ArgoCD installed on a management cluster to manage nearly all resources on the child cluster(s) it manages. Here "nearly all" means ArgoCD will not be responsible for creating/destroying workspaces.

## GitOps using ArgoCD

*Questions*:
1. What CI/CD tool is K8TRE going to use?
2. Should the tool deploy and manage applications to the same cluster it is installed on or deploy applications to other clusters? i.e. in-cluster vs cross-cluster architecture?
3. What are the limits of what the CI/CD tool manages?

    1. Argo CD.
    2. Cross-cluster architecture supports two sub-models: 
        - deployment of K8TRE to dev/test/prod clusters from a single ArgoCD installation
        - deployment of one K8TRE per project or deployment of ephemeral K8TRE development environments for each developer.
    3. In the JupyterHub control plane model, JupyterHub is responsible for creating/destroying workspaces, not ArgoCD. ArgoCD will complain that JupyterHub is out-of-sync because of the new resources but there are ways of addressing this.
